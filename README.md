# MP‑PPRL

**MP‑PPRL**  
A Java‑based project for **Multi‑Party Privacy‑Preserving Record Linkage (MP‑PPRL)**.

This repository contains code and resources for implementing multi‑party privacy‑preserving record linkage protocols. MP‑PPRL enables multiple parties to securely link records referring to the same entities across different datasets *without revealing sensitive personal information between parties*.

Multi‑party PPRL is an important research area in data privacy, especially when linking data from **more than two sources** while protecting privacy, accuracy and scalability.
